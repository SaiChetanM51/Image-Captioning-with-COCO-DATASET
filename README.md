# Image-Captioning-with-COCO-DATASET
This repository contains the code for an image captioning project implemented in TensorFlow. The model is trained on the COCO (Common Objects in Context) 2017 dataset to generate descriptive captions for images. This project serves as a practical example of how to build and train a deep learning model for a creative NLP task.
